JavaScript has been the primary language for application development in browsers and with the advent of JIT compilers, it is increasingly becoming popular on server side developement as well. However JavaScript suffers from vulnerabilities like cross site scripting and malicious advertisement code on the the client side and on the serve side from SQL injection and cross site request forgery as well.

In this paper we present a dynamic approach to efficiently tracking information flow and taint detection to aid in mitigation and prevention such attacks using JavaScript based hygenic macro language Sweet.JS. We use Sweet.js and object proxies to override built in JavaScript operators to track information flow and detect tatinted values. We also demonstrate taint detection and information flow analysis using our techinique in a REST service running on on Node.JS.
